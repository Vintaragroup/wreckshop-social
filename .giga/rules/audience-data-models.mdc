## Fan Profile Model
Importance Score: 95/100

Core data structures for fan profiling:
- Music taste analysis with weighted genre preferences
- Platform-specific engagement scores across streaming services
- Geographic targeting data with custom radius support
- Custom segmentation tags based on behavioral patterns
- Artist affinity scoring with temporal decay

## Segmentation Rules Engine
Importance Score: 90/100

Segment definition model:
- Multi-criteria rule builder supporting:
  - Music preferences (genres, artists, platforms)
  - Geographic boundaries
  - Engagement levels
  - Platform-specific metrics
- Nested logical operators (AND/OR/NOT)
- Dynamic audience size estimation
- Segment inheritance and composition

## Engagement Scoring Algorithm
Importance Score: 85/100

Fan engagement calculation framework:
- Platform-weighted engagement metrics
- Time-decay factors for historical interactions
- Artist-specific engagement multipliers
- Custom scoring rules per platform:
  - Spotify: stream counts, saves, playlist adds
  - Instagram: story views, post interactions
  - YouTube: watch time, subscription status
  - TikTok: video completions, shares

## Platform Metrics Model
Importance Score: 80/100

Unified metrics framework:
- Standardized engagement metrics across platforms
- Platform-specific data normalization rules
- Cross-platform identity resolution
- Aggregate fan value scoring
- Custom weight assignments per metric type
