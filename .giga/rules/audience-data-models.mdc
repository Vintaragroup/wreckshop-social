# audience-data-models

Core Audience Data Models:

1. Fan Profile Schema
- Composite identity resolution across music platforms
- Progressive enrichment states: discovered -> verified -> enriched -> scored
- Platform-specific engagement metrics normalization
- Custom affinity scoring (0-100) for genres, artists, and scenes
- Geographic clustering with venue/event affinities
Importance Score: 95

2. Segmentation Rules Engine

  * Apple Music: library_add=3, pre_save=4
  * YouTube: subscribe=4, comment=2, share=3
  * Instagram: save=2, share=3, comment=1
- Time-decay functions for engagement freshness
- Cross-platform activity correlation
- Custom multipliers for super-fan behavior
Importance Score: 85

4. Platform-Specific Metrics

## Core Fan Profile Model

Key data structures modeling music fan attributes across platforms:

```typescript
interface FanProfile {
  // Core identity 
  id: string
  platforms: PlatformIdentity[]
  
  // Music preferences
  genreAffinities: {[genre: string]: number} // 0-100 scores
  artistTypes: string[] // e.g. "indie", "mainstream"
  
  // Engagement metrics
  platformEngagement: {
    spotify: SpotifyMetrics
    instagram: InstagramMetrics
    tiktok: TiktokMetrics
  }

  // Geographic
  locations: GeoLocation[]
  marketSegments: string[]
}
```

## Segmentation Rules

Complex audience filtering based on:

1. Music Taste Criteria
- Genre affinity thresholds (e.g. indie rock > 80)
- Artist type matches
- Platform-specific engagement levels

2. Geographic Rules  
- Venue radius targeting
- Music scene clustering
- Market-based segmentation

3. Behavioral Scoring
- Platform activity weights
- Content engagement metrics 
- Artist interaction patterns

## Discovery Algorithm

Custom fan matching implementation:
- Progressive profile enrichment
- Cross-platform identity resolution
- Taste similarity scoring
- Geographic market alignment
- Engagement level classification

Importance Score: 95/100

The high score reflects the sophisticated domain-specific modeling of music fan data and complex segmentation rules unique to the music industry marketing domain.
