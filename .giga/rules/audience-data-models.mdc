# audience-data-models

Core Data Models and Algorithms:

1. Fan Profile Structure
- Cross-platform identity resolution across music services
- Normalized engagement scoring (0-100)
- Genre affinity calculation based on listening history
- Platform-specific metrics aggregation
- VIP status determination rules

2. Segmentation Engine (src/components/segment-builder.tsx)
- Complex nested AND/OR rule builder for music fan targeting
- Genre-based audience filtering
- Platform-specific engagement thresholds
- Artist affinity scoring (0-100%)
- Estimated reach calculations

3. Profile Discovery System (src/pages/audience/profiles-discover.tsx)
- Cross-platform music fan discovery
- Genre-based candidate matching
- Social graph relationship analysis
- Platform-specific handle parsing
- Bulk ingestion workflow

4. Taste Analysis Pipeline (backend/src/services/ingest/ingest.service.ts)
- Multi-platform profile aggregation
- Interest tag derivation from listening history
- Artist affinity calculations
- Social graph metrics normalization
- Identity merging/deduplication

5. Platform Integration Models (backend/src/providers/*.provider.ts)
- Provider-specific identity resolution
- Platform-specific taste extraction
- Normalized music taste modeling
- Social relationship mapping
- Rate limiting handling

Key Metrics:
- Artist Affinity Score (0-100)
- Platform Engagement Level
- Genre Match Percentage
- Social Graph Depth
- VIP Status Threshold
