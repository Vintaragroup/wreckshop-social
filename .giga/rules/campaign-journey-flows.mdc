## Core Journey Orchestration Engine

Journey Step Processor coordinates multi-channel campaign flows:

```typescript
// Key journey states and transitions
enum JourneyStepState {
  PENDING,
  IN_PROGRESS,
  COMPLETED,
  ERROR,
  ABANDONED
}

// Core journey step types
enum StepType {
  EMAIL,
  SMS,
  SOCIAL,
  WAIT,
  DECISION,
  ACTION
}
```

Journey execution logic enforces:
- Wait time calculations between steps
- Concurrency limits per channel
- Audience segment qualification rules
- Cross-channel frequency caps
- Geographic delivery windows

## Campaign Sequencing Rules

Campaign orchestration implements industry-specific timing logic:

1. Pre-Release Campaigns
- Automated release date synchronization
- Platform-specific pre-save scheduling
- Staggered announcement sequencing

2. Tour/Event Campaigns  
- Geographic radius-based targeting
- Venue capacity-driven segmentation
- Presale/onsale coordination

3. Music Release Campaigns
- Cross-platform release alignment
- Genre-specific timing optimization
- Follower growth acceleration

## Performance Optimization Engine

Real-time optimization system adjusts:
- Send time selection based on engagement patterns
- Channel selection per audience segment
- Content personalization by music preferences
- Geographic delivery windows
- Platform-specific delivery rules

Importance Score: 90/100
