### Release Model 
- ISRC/UPC handling with duplicate detection
- Multi-platform release state tracking (draft, scheduled, published)
- Rights management with territory restrictions
- Revenue attribution across distribution channels
- Release type classification (album, EP, single)

### Event Model
- Venue capacity and ticket tier management
