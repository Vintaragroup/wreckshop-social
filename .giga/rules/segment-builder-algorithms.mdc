## Rule Hierarchy Implementation
The segment builder uses a nested rule structure for defining audience segments:

- Root Group (AND/OR)
  - Rule Groups (AND/OR) 
    - Individual Rules
      - Field Selection
      - Operator Selection 
      - Value Input

Each rule group maintains its own logical operator (AND/OR) that determines how child rules are combined. Groups can be nested up to 3 levels deep.

Importance Score: 85

## Condition Mapping
The segment builder maps user-selected conditions to database queries:

1. Field Mapping
- Profile attributes (demographics, preferences)
- Engagement metrics (opens, clicks, purchases)
- Custom fields (tags, segments)

2. Operator Mapping 
- String: contains, starts with, ends with
- Numeric: equals, greater than, less than
- Date: before, after, between
- Boolean: is, is not

3. Value Validation
- Type checking based on field
- Range validation for numeric fields
- Format validation for dates
- List validation for enums

Importance Score: 90

## Audience Size Calculation
Real-time audience size estimation using:

1. Rule Group Analysis
- Parse rule group structure
- Build optimized query plan
- Calculate group matches

2. Profile Scanning
- Scan profile collection
- Apply rule filters
- Track matching profiles

3. Size Approximation
- Sample-based estimation for large segments
- Exact count for small segments
- Progressive refinement as rules change

Importance Score: 95
