# segment-builder-algorithms

The segment builder implements hierarchical rule composition for music audience targeting with the following key components:

## Rule Hierarchy
- Root groups contain nested rule groups connected by AND/OR operators
- Individual rules evaluate profile attributes using domain-specific operators
- Groups can be infinitely nested with alternating logical operators
- Rule evaluation order follows music industry targeting best practices

## Condition Mapping
Key profile attributes for segmentation:
- Platform presence (Spotify, Apple Music, etc)
- Artist follows/engagement
- Genre preferences with weighted scores
- Event attendance history
- Purchase behavior (merch, tickets)
- Geographic location for touring

Operator mappings:
- Numeric: equals, greater/less than, between
- String: contains, starts with, exact match
- Array: includes any, includes all, excludes
- Boolean: is true/false
- DateTime: before, after, between

## Size Calculation
Real-time audience size estimation using:
1. Initial segment scan on rule creation
2. Progressive refinement based on new profile matches
3. Platform-specific multipliers for reach estimation
4. Statistical sampling for large audience sets
5. Cached intermediary results for common rule combinations

Key files:
- src/components/segment-builder.tsx
- src/components/profile-export-modal.tsx

Business Rules:
1. Genre rules use fuzzy matching with synonyms
2. Artist rules account for variations in artist names
3. Platform rules check both active and historical presence
4. Geographic rules support touring radius calculations
5. Engagement scores use weighted averages across platforms

Importance Score: 85/100
